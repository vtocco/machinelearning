This repo goes over using Python and a built in model from Keras. We can classify images through a web app using the flask framework as the server, and some basic javascript/jQuery on the front end to handle files. 

The tensorflowjs directory is a separate project that uses the javascript version of the library and the users webcam to classify images from the mobilenet data. It allows the user to train with 3-4 images and the app can detect the image based on the training.
